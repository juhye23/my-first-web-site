<p><strong>Baseball is a bat-and-ball sport played between two teams of nine players each, taking turns batting and fielding.</strong></p>
<p>The game occurs over the course of several plays, with each play generally beginning when a player on the fielding team, called the pitcher, throws a ball that a player on the batting team, called the batter, tries to hit with a bat.</p></body>
